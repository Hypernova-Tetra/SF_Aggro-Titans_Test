* R1: Further fixing QTE files so QTE inputs register properly.



V0.22

* Adjustments to Supreme's QTE files for better pacing and to cut down on length for some.

V0.21

* New Grand Slam animation for Hyper Sonic skin option when selecting "ParryMiss QTE option".
* "Zev\_Parrymiss\_Riflebeast.pac" adjusted to remove a detail that didn't quite make sense.

V0.20

* Files reuploaded to the GitHub Repo
* Tweaks and adjustments made to Boss Health and Attack Patterns to both Rifle01 and Riflebeast
* Added Holoska's code for "AT\_SHOT2" to play "Zev\_Rfl\_Sp02"
* Updated "Event/Scene/bo4xxx.pac" (For bo4110)

V0.19

* Some adjustments to Supreme's attack speed and attack patterns.
* Adjusted Supreme's "attackHomingLaser" and "attackHandLaser" parameters.
* Adjusted "immediateActions" parameters

V0.18

* Riflebeast "attackPattern" and "attackPatternAfter" slightly changed.
* Riflebeast "attackHominglaserPattern" slightly changed.
* Adjusted Winglaser\_2 slightly. Fixed a problem where the QTE didn't fail immediately on the wrong button press. Second QTE prompt changed: "TheEndVariant" -> "PressPrompt".
* Other slight changes.

V0.17

* A fix for SSCyber and SSDamage model and assets not loading in the cutscene.
* Event/Scene bo6140 (Phase2) updated. Overlapping voices of Sage, Amy, Knux, and Tails are fixed.
* Adjustment to Event/Scene bo6190 (The Finale) for Hyper Sonic skins that may include slightly altered camera angle shots and added effects when Sonic going full Cyber attacks Supreme and The End.
* Reduced file size for "bo6190.usm". Eggman's scope HUD shows up in Realtime now, but only during Eggman's glasses. The scope P.O.V. still remains pre-rendered for now. I doubt I can get the POV working for Realtime.
* Event/Scene "bo4110" is slightly updated.

* Fixed cutscene "ev5040" where it loaded as a black screen.
* Fixed cutscene "ev6030" where it loaded as a black screen. Another adjustment was made to the location of Eggman and his computer console. The scene is located at the start of Ouranos Island as a temporary workaround until I figure out a way to load Chaos Island's assets to get him in his proper spot.
* ev1770 and ev5020 use the Beta Super Sonic transformation effects.
* "Boss\_Bit\_Param" was adjusted. 2 attacks from the drone's attack patterns have their order swapped.
* "smallbit\_Laser" rotation speed adjusted. Is now the 1st drone attack that occurs when the fight starts. Before it was the 3rd attack.
* "smallbit\_Homing" homingDelay and homingAccuracy slightly adjusted. Is now the 3rd attack that the drones do in order. Before it was the 1st attack.
* Event/Scene "Zev\_rfl\_Sp02" in Retooled option received animation updates during the fail scene.
* Event/Scene "Zev\_rfl\_Shoot01" and "02 in "Retooled" Option (The extended Bitlaser01 and 02 animations) received an animation update: Extended frames during the QTE button mash phase. Different fail animation implemented depending on if the wrong button was pressed or no button was pressed, timing out the chance to win the QTE.
* Updated "Winglaser\_2" animation
* Changed the "flyMoveCircleRadius" parameter so that he doesn't fly too far away and end up stuck against the Ouranos pyramid temple with no way to reach him, soft-locking he fight.

* Supreme's @attack\_counter01 animation file swapped with @attack\_counter04.

V0.14

* Rearranged files
* Adjusted Red Circle QTE on "Zev\_Blow" for Fixed Vanilla option
* Small Adjustment to the "Winglaser\_2" QTE (This is still being worked on)
* Added some effects to the QTE scene from file "test\_qte\_sample"
* Fixed incorrect Resource Pointer from "Zev\_rfl\_Sp02"
* Adjusted "bo6xxx.pac" for the Hyper Sonic skin option as it was an outdated version of what I used for the Monologue mod.
* "Zev\_rfl\_Shoot01" had an issue with Sonic being in the wrong spot when failing parts of the QTE. So this scene was updated with new fail scenes.

Work In Progress



#### **Version 0 Demo**

***Rifle01 - Supreme***

* Increased HP
* Slightly faster attacks
* A complete overhaul to his attack patterns
* Multiple attack patterns at different HP thresholds.
* All possible unused attacks from Supreme are restored.
* All possible unused attacks by Supreme's drones have been restored.
* Every now-and-then Supreme will interrupt the player to perform a counterattack. (This is known as "immediateActions" in the rfl file)
* Added Wings for Phase 2 (Thank the heavens and thank everyone that helped me through getting this to work.)
* An overhaul to the boss's sound effects for certain attacks, certain cutscene sounds were moved to .usm files to make room for new sounds.
* Supreme's "@attack\_counter" (Which is known as AT\_Counterblow in the rfl) can randomly play different animations. (Thanks to Holoska for this.) Due to this change, it also affects Giganto as they share the exact same animation file name.
* Supreme's QTEs have a random selection of events that trigger when Supreme's drones are destroyed at certain points of the fight. (Thanks to Holoska for this too.)
* Certain animation files of Supreme in the base fight were tweaked just so that it's not a complete copy-paste of Giganto.
* "Zev\_Rfl\_Bitlaser" is now a QTE.
* All unused QTEs restored with tweaks to have it be somewhat unique.
* New QTEs in a "Retooled" option for the mod that may feature new animations but definitely uses some unused animation files that were hiding in the files.
* A new QTE during Phase 2 only that utilizes his wings, even though it's just him shooting a bigger laser than "@attack\_CounterSp02".
* Extended Intro and Revised Outro scene.
* Certain miscellaneous details have been fixed.
* Missing effects from Supreme's "@attack\_counterSp02" and "smallBit\_laser" have been restored, thanks again Holoska.

Things to do:

* Fix the error of Supreme's Cylinders. The middle one on his shoulders don't show during gameplay.
* Continue checking for bugs and issues.

***Riflebeast - The End***

* Increased HP
* Increased cable HP. (Cyloop may be recommended to break the cable now.)
* Alternate attacks between his Hominglaser Orbs and Triple Claw attack.
* Slightly changed his attack patterns.
* Possibly fixed the issue with trees obscuring the player's view, but this may come with a new issue of obscuring the view of the Homing orbs attacking Sonic. This still needs to be further tested.
* Slightly increased Hominglaser\_Orbs' attack speed.
* Fixed a mis-render. "Super Sonic 2" should now be seen instead of regular Super Sonic when the Phase 2 cutscene plays. Don't know how this ended up happening.
* Fixed the Realtime Cutscene's Mod for Cutscene Bo6190 where Eggman's HUD scope isn't shown.
* Fixed a mis-render of SS2's aura not visible when performing the QTE of escaping Supreme's grip, after failing the initial Final Blow QTE
* Fixed another mis-render of SS2 himself not being visible when escaping Supreme's grip.
* There's an option for said "Final Blow QTE" in the mod to either use the original version, or an edited version to where the latter half of the Final Blow QTE isn't reusing the "Parrymiss" QTE. The QTE prompts are also changed in the initial parts of the QTE.
* The End Monologue from base game is implemented followed by a restoration of unused captions related to said monologue. This is a togglable option.
* Added a slow-mo effect when parrying Supreme's "Triple Claw" attack. I also slightly modified beast's normally unseen animation where his hand recoils after the attack is parried.
* Slightly modified SS2's transformations in both bo6120 and bo6165. This may need further tweaking for performance's sake.
* Originally in Phase 1, Supreme would enter a stunned state when his health reaches 50%. This has been changed so that he gets stunned when his health reaches 0.
